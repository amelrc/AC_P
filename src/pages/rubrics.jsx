        <p>
          Leon van Gelder is a High-school in Groningen that uses a grading
          system based on rubrics. This means students review each otherâ€™s
          skills instead of the ordinary grading system.

          The app had a really basic layout and was not user-friendly. My job
          was to program the UI in pure vanilla javascript. The app is optimised
          for the Microsoft Surface Go which was the device used by all school
          personnel.
